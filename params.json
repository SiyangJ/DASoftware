{"name":"DASoftware","tagline":"Matlab library of data assimilation methods","body":"# DASoftware\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis is a Matlab library of data assimilation methods developed to solve large-scale state-parameter estimation problems. Data assimilation approach has been widely used in geophysics, hydrology and numerical weather forecast to improve the forecast from a numerical model based on data sets collected in real time. Conventional approach like Kalman filter is computatioanlly prohibitive for large problems. The DASoftware library takes advantage of advances in computational science and consists of new data assimilation approach that is scalable for large-scale problems. The functions and examples are produced based on collabrated work on data assimialtion documented in the papers listed in the Reference section.\r\n\r\n## Start with examples\r\n\r\nWe have provided the users linear and nonlinear state estimation problems to get familier with data assimilation methods provided in the library.  \r\n### Example 1: Saetrom\r\n\r\n```\r\n[sol,true]=main('prm-saetrom.txt')\r\n```\r\n## Select different methods\r\n\r\nHere we show a diagram of the methods provided in the library.\r\n\r\n|  Method  |  Assumptions                 |  Jacobian matrix|  Covariance matrix |   \r\n| -------: |:----------------------------:|:------------------------: |:--------------|   \r\n|  HiKF    | fast data acquisition/fixed H| no forward run| O(m) operations |\r\n|          | random-walk forward model    | |  |\r\n|  CSKF    |    smooth problem            | r forward run | O(m) operations|\r\n|  SpecKF  | approximate uncertainty/fixed H| p forward run|  O(m) operations|\r\n|  EnKF    | monte carlo based approach   | r forward run | O(m) operations|\r\n\r\n#### Reference:\r\n1.
